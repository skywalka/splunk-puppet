#####Welcome to the Puppet Dashboard#####

#The meaning and purpose of this app is to give you a glimpse on some of the enhanced features in 
#puppet for creating a really nice dashboard.
#Everything was created by myself only the pictures are taken from Iconspedia.com. Please refere to 
#the manual on how to use the features. I hope you find this app usefull, any feedback is welcomed.

#Puppet is an open source data center automation and configuration management framework. Puppet 
#provides system administrators with a simplified platform that allows for consistent, transparent, 
#and flexible systems management.


######What is Puppet#####

#Puppet.s declarative language describes your system configuration, allowing you to easily reproduce 
#any configuration on any number of additional systems. Additionally, Puppet can help establish and 
#enforce approved system configurations automatically correcting systems that drift from their 
#baseline. Puppet provides an audit trail of all your systems, which can easily be kept in version 
#control for compliance purposes.

#####The Views#####

#In total there are six different views, which all show an other data ouput from puppet on the 
#systems.

#The views are the following six:

#    * Information
#    * Consistency
#    * Module Changes
#    * Module Statistics
#    * Updates
#    * Without Puppetrun


#The different views are self explanatory. The necessary information to understand the views is 
#directly on each view. Check them out and you will see what they do.
