Puppet provides system administrators with a simplified platform that allows for consistent, transparent, and flexible systems management.</p><p>Puppet.s declarative language describes your system configuration, allowing you to easily reproduce any configuration on any number of additional systems. Additionally, Puppet can help establish and enforce approved system configurations automatically correcting systems that drift from their baseline. Puppet provides an audit trail of all your systems, which can easily be kept in version control for compliance purposes.</p></font>
